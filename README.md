# COL106
Data Structures and Algorithms course

This repository consists of the some of the assignment we did during the course COL106 namely Data Structures and Algorithm.
Through these assignments, I got an opportunity to know about various data structures like Heaps, Stacks, Trees, etc...
We learnt about topics like Hashing, pattern matching for instance in KMP Algorithm.
These assignments were a perfect way to implement my theoretical knowledge and also observe how it is used in the real world.
